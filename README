Has Encrypted Attributes
=====================================

Allows a model to store attributes encrypted in the database. It seamlessly 
encrypts/decrypts the data for use within the application.

Can set the key in the definition using :key => <key string> or by providing 
an association that contains the key.

Using :except in the definition allows for unencrypted attributes in the mix.
By default the _id of the association is excluded (ie: user_id), if needed 
and the usual created_at, updated_at, created_on, updated_on columns.

Requires:
  crypt gem : used for the Blowfish symmetric algorithm


Example
=====================================

class Secrets
  has_encrypted_attributes :key => 'THIS IS MY KEY TEXT'
end

class MoreSecrets
  has_encrypted_attributes :association => :user
  # looks for key in self.user.key
end

class StillMoreSecrets
  has_encrypted_attributes :association => :user, :key_method => :salt
  # looks for key in self.user.salt
end

class MostSecrets
  has_encrypted_attributes :exclude => [:year, :count]
  # will not try to encrypt year and count attributes
end
